    "First, we explain the list comprehension.  Instead of pulling out values of a list according to a condition, with `[x for x in LIST if CONDITION]`, we have created a new list based on performing a function each element of a list.  The syntax, used above, is `[FUNCTION(x) for x in LIST]`.  These two methods of list comprehension can be combined, in fact.  The most general syntax for list comprehension is `[FUNCTION(x) for x in LIST if CONDITION]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a list comprehension can be carried out on a numpy array, but the result is a plain Python list.  It will be better to have a numpy array instead for what follows, so we use the `numpy.array()` function to convert the list into a numpy array."

    "### Prime gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last bit of data analysis, we consider the **prime gaps**.  These are the numbers that occur as differences between consecutive primes.  Since all primes except 2 are odd, all prime gaps are even except for the 1-unit gap between 2 and 3.  There are many unsolved problems about prime gaps; the most famous might be that a gap of 2 occurs infinitely often (as in the gaps between 3,5 and between 11,13 and between 41,43, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our data set of prime numbers, it is not hard to create a data set of prime gaps.  Recall that `primes` is our list of prime numbers up to 1 million."

    "1.  Create functions `redprimes_upto(x)` and `blueprimes_upto(x)` which count the number of red/blue primes up to a given number `x`.  Recall that we defined red/blue primes to be those of the form 4n+1 or 4n+3, respectively.  Graph the relative proportion of red/blue primes as `x` varies from 1 to 1 million.  E.g., are the proportions 50%/50% or 70%/30%, and how do these proportions change?  Note:  this is also visualized in [An Illustrated Theory of Numbers](http://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-105) and you can read [an article by Rubinstein and Sarnak](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1048515870) for more.\n",
